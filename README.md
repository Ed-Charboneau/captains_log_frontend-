### Example Code

### Issues and Resolutions
I was on my own for this project and sturggled with a lot of the front and backend parts to make a complete working app. I had a lot of help from the instructional team and classmates to help me push though all my issues and link everything up.  While I decided to work on the main branch I still faced some issues with no enough commits or not using the correct commands in Github.  I can use some extra Github experience under my belt to feel more comfortable.

Deployment using Surge was painless and Heroku was definately not as user friendly as I would like.  I believe with more time my comfort level would improve and some of these issue would be eliminated.  

### Additional Comments
I seem to enjoy spending more time to style or think of craative backgrounds to utilize for my projects.  I feel I am stronger on the design aspect than the actual coding portion of the projects and it tends to show.
